## Description

The Construction of this project is based around the use of Node.js with an added inquirer (npm @8.2.4). Under the initilzation of "index.js" in your pc's intergrated terminal
the usert will be able to fill out a questionnaire which will upon completion generate a corresponding "logo.svg" file containing a generated logo based off the users previous inputs.
Generated logo should contain a "shape", "shape color" and finally a text colour combining all 3 elements into a finished generated product on a live server.

## Usage

* Using this project is very straight forward and first time user friendly, ensure you have your Node.js installed along with the "inquirer i @8.2.4" before running the program in your intergrated terminal.
* Open your intergrated terminal and perform your "node /index.js" this will run your index.js file and begin the logo.svg generator questionnaire.
* Upon completing the questionnaire the code will run and generate the user a "logo.svg" file which can be viewed in a live server to check functionality and that the logo has generated properly.
* Both the "index.js" and "generateMarkdown.js" follow the exact same semantic coding structure for easy user interactability. A comprehensible coding structure also allows other developers an easier understanding of how the code interacts with one another which can be used for future use and/or revision.
* (Video walkthrough to expand on usage and coding structure attatched upon submission)
